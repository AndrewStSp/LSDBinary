# LSDBinary: pushing least-squares deconvolution (LSD) to the next level by generalising it to binary stars

## Motivation
With the amount, and more importantly unprecedented quality of (space-based) photometric and (ground-based) spectroscopic observations available nowadays, considerable time and effort are being spent to improve methods and techniques for the analysis of stars in binary and higher order multiple systems. The need to achieve extremely high signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) to be able to detected low-amplitude magnetic signatures in polarisation spectra has driven development of the Least-Squares Deconvolution (LSD; Donati et al. 1997, MNRAS, 291, 658) multi-line averaging technique. The LSD profiles obtained with this methods are also ideal for inference of radial velocities of stars (including those in binary systems) and to study temporal spectral changes due to intrinsic variability of stars. Here, we present a generalisation of the original LSD method to binary stars. In particular, we focus on the determination of precise, orbital phase-resolved radial velocities (RV) of the individual binary components with a careful treatment of the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect (Rossiter 1924, ApJ, 60, 15; McLaughlin 1924, ApJ, 60, 22).
